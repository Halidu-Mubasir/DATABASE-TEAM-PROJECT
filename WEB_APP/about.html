        <h1>CASE STUDY: NORTHERN ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION COMPANY (NEDCo)</h1> 
        <p>
            Northern Electricity Distribution Company (NEDCo) was established to distribute electricity in the Brong-Ahafo, Northern, <br> 
            Upper East and Upper West Regions of Ghana as part of VRA’s 161kV transmission grid extension to the northern parts of Ghana.<br>
            NEDCo's current operations extend to the northern parts of Oti, Ashanti and Western North regions. Although NEDCo’s operations <br>
            cover about 64% of the geographical area of Ghana, the customer density of the operating area is low with access to electricity <br>
            in the NEDCo operational area put at 65% as at December 2017 as against about 84% for the whole country. The Ghana Government, <br>
            in line with its vision of making electricity available to at least, 90% of the population by 2020, has undertaken power extension <br>
            over the years to new towns and communities that were hitherto not served by NEDCo. The customer population has, therefore, grown at <br>
            an average rate of about 13% plus per annum from less than 20,000 in 1987 to 888,023 by March 2019. Residential customers <br>
            constitute 81.39% of the total customers; Non-Residential customers constitute 18.60% while the Special Load Tariff (SLT) <br>
            customers constitute only 0.01%.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <h2>OPERATIONS</h2>

        <p>
            NEDCo's operations in the regions are managed by five branch offices designated as Area Offices in the following cities: <br>
            Sunyani, Techiman, Tamale, Wa and Bolgatanga. The head office of NEDCo is strategically located in Tamale, the Capital of <br>
            the Northern Region. The Head Office administration is now headed by a Managing Director, supported by five functional Managers namely <br>
            Technical, Human Resource, Finance, Commercial and Real Estate Managers. There is also an Audit Head who reports administratively to <br>
            the Managing Director. Each Area is headed by a manager supported by an Engineer, Finance Officer, Commercial Officer, IT Officer and <br>
            a Human Resource Officer.

        <h3>REASON FOR THIS PROJECT</h3>
        <p>
            The Northern Electricity Department (NED) of the Volta River Authority (VRA) distributes electricity <br>
            in the Brong-Ahafo, Northern, Upper East, Upper West, Savannah, Bono, Bon East, Ashanti, Oti and Western regions. <br>
            The workforce aspires to be a self-sustaining electric power distribution company and a safe and reliable <br> 
            supplier of electricity to homes and businesses in a commercially viable manner. This cannot be achieved when there are inefficiencies. <br>
            NEDCO finds itself in a situation of paying tariffs. Some Customers are not paying the entirety of the electricity consumed for example <br>
            through mistakes in the bills, failure to pay or illegal power tapping. Management would like to have information about accurate bills in the various regions. <br>
            Managers would also like to keep records of customers who are indebted across the various branches as well as the transactions that happen <br>
            between them and their suppliers across the countries of their scope.
